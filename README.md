# Predicting Genre of Spotify Songs
To predict the genre of songs, I built a Multiclass Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost in R using Kaggle dataset [Dataset of songs in Spotify](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/dataset-of-songs-in-spotify).
## Project Background
Spotify is a digital music service that gives customers access to millions of songs. To provide better customer services, Spotify provides different genre-based playlists for the customers to discover. There are many different types of genres in music, based on the way or style of music is composed. Thus, this project aims to see if we can correctly predict the music genre of a song and which audio features are important when forecasting.
